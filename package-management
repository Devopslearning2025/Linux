PACKAGE MANAGEMENT:
=====================
A package manager is a command-line or graphical tool used to automate the process of installing, updating, and removing software packages on a Linux system. Software packages are collections of files, including executables, libraries, configuration files, and documentation, that are bundled together for easy distribution and installation

Functionalities of Package Manager in Linux:
----------------------------------------------
INSTALLATION: Package managers facilitate the installation of software packages from repositories or local files. They automatically handle dependencies, ensuring that all required components are installed.
DEPENDENCY RESOLUTION: Linux software often relies on other packages. Package managers detect these dependencies and fetch and install them automatically.
UPGRADING: Package managers allow users to update installed software to the latest versions. This helps in keeping the system secure and up-to-date.
UNINSTALL: Uninstalling software is straightforward with package managers. They ensure that all related files and dependencies are removed, preventing conflicts.
QUERYING: Users can query the package manager to get information about installed packages, available updates, and package details.
